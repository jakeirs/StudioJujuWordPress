                strong I have an idea . Can you design my tattoo?
              p Yes, we certainly can. We do this a lot. We would expect you to meet us for a consultation (it is free of charge). You could bring with you any pictures you have collected as a reference or just describe your idea and we will help you to come up with a design that you will be proud to wear.

                strong How much will the tattoo cost roughly?
              p It is very difficult to quote a price until we have a clearer picture of what you actually want. The price depends very much on the size, design and placement of your tattoo . You can email your ideas to us or even better meet us for a free consultation. The price will never be bigger than the maximum estimated quote.

                strong Will i see the design before? 
              p Normally we do not send the designs before. If you like our work, you should trust us with your tattoo as we put all our heart in to perfecting a design specifically for you. Also, there is no greater feeling than waiting with curiosity and excitement for "the day". If you provide us with detailed description, we will prepare your design based on that. On the day of tattooing, there is always enough time to introduce changes to the design.
              p
                strong How do I prepare for the tattoo?
              p Make sure to have a good breakfast and a good nightsâ€™ sleep the night before. It is recommended to apply moisturiser every day for two weeks before tattooing , especially if your skin is dry (like skin on hands or tanned and dry skin). We also recommend that you bring snacks and water, especially if it is going to be a longer session. Avoid sun exposure (ideally a month at least) before and after tattooing. The color of a tattoo on untanned skin is always more vivid and lasts longer. After you get your tattoo. we would advise  using 50+ suncream protection.
              p
                strong How do I take care if my new tattoo?
              p You will receive full aftercare advice from us both verbally and we will also give you a written aftercare sheet to take away with you. On the first day no cream is needed so you can buy any cream needed the next day. If you have any concerns about your tattoo whilst it is healing we are only a call or message away so don't hesitate to contact us.
